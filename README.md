While each of the individual working on the component of a particular version that may be similar to the other. The historic versions of software are always important, in situations where the system would want to switch to older versions due to the bugs that they uncounted or the software is not compatible to their system. On the other hand, the change management refers to the changes done by the developers, users and other associated members that are involved in the management of the system.All these includes the requests for the fixing of bugs and other new features that needs to be added. With all these managements it needs focused and interested personal who had the interest to pursue on the project without giving up easily. Lastly, bug fixes are the most important thing during the development and execution phase, the requests from other people to change the system may have some consequences on other people using the software’s interface. So generally, version management refers effectively tracking and controlling the changes in the set of related entities.
